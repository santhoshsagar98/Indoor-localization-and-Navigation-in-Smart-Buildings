# Problem Statement

Infrastructure in the modern world is expanding in size, footfall and intelligence. With trends like Industry 4.0 and Smart City development and population growth in urban cities. These large structures like office complexes, schools and shopping centers they by themselves become micro-environments. For intelligent use of space and management of crowd and convenience for the denizen services like indoor navigation and localisation are required.


# Literature Review 

The concept of smart cities are rapidly being considered by the government as the future of urbanization. The use of Internet of things will drive to the realization of these smart cities[1]. This will in turn lead to the advent of smart offices, smart shopping centers, smart campuses etc. As these infrastructures get smarter and larger, they by them self start to constitute a micro-environment[2]. There is an increasing trend and demand to know the location and movement pattern of denizens in these micro-environment for better productivity, space allotment and easy navigation. Building a system based on IoT will be the way forward to design a smart building with smart location awareness, navigation and dynamic space allotment[3]. As GPS is Line of Sight Dependent(LoS) and GPS only provides a maximum accuracy up to 5 meters, this technology is not suitable for indoor positioning[4]. There is now widespread research in using R.F signals like WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN or Zigbee to find indoor position. The Received Signal Strength Indication(RSSI) of these signals can determine the distance between the user and scanner of these signals[5]. There inaccuracies that arise from this method due to occlusions like wall and doors which will signal loss and attenuation thus providing inaccurate distance estimates[6]. These errors can be overcome by using algorithms like trilateration and error suppression like methods like kalman filter and k-nearest neighbour[7]. Thus providing an accurate framework to predict indoor location of the user.
